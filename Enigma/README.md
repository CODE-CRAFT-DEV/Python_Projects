Enigma Machine Simulation
This Python script simulates the workings of the Enigma machine, a cipher device used during World War II. The code includes classes for the keyboard, plugboard, rotors, and reflector, which together enable the encryption and decryption of messages.

Components
Keyboard: Converts letters to signals and vice versa.
Plugboard: Swaps pairs of letters to add complexity.
Rotors: Three rotors with configurable wiring and notches, which rotate to change the signal path.
Reflector: Reflects the signal back through the rotors.
Enigma: Combines all components to encipher and decipher messages.
Usage
Initialize Components: Create instances of the keyboard, plugboard, rotors, and reflector.
Configure Enigma Machine: Set the ring settings and initial key.
Encrypt Message: Use the encipher method to encrypt each letter of the message.
